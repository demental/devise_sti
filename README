== Rails 3.1rc4 + devise + Single table inheritance = fail

This app demonstrats the issue I'm having with devise and single table inheritance: 

I have two devise_for : admins and users

the Admin model inherits from User model.

When trying to access resources accessible only for admins (@see posts_controller#index), I get redirected to admins/signin although an admin is signed in.

1. git clone

2. rvm use 1.9.2p180@devise_sti_issue --create

3. bundle install

6. rspec spec/controllers/posts_controller_spec.rb

7. see test fail
